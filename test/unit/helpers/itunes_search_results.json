            "description": "Do you have a huge pile of coins waiting to be counted?  Then this app is for you.  Group the coins by type, point the camera at each group, and let the app do the counting!\n\nEven if you lack a huge pile of coins, this is still a cool app for showing off your iOS device to friends!\n\nDisclaimer: To be absolutely clear, this app does not identify your coins.  You have to tell it what type of coins it is looking at.  Think of it more as an advanced coin tallying app.\n\nThis app works by using image recognition libraries from the OpenCV project to detect circular objects in the camera's view.  The circle detection sensitivity can be adjusted with a single slider.  A convenient user interface assists in tallying the sum of the coins.\n\nDetailed Instructions:\n\n1. Download this app.\n\n2. Separate your pile of coins.\n\n3. Spread the coins out in each group so that no coins are on top of each other, and so that the groups are clearly separated.\n\n4. Start the app.\n\n5. Point the camera at one group such that only that group is visible on the screen.\n\n6. Adjust the detection sensitivity slider until green circles are placed around every coin in the group, and no extra circles appear anywhere else.\n\n7. The app's image processing algorithms automatically self-calibrate based on the current lighting and focus to identify the coins.  It displays the number of coins it counts in the bottom right hand corner.\n\n8. When the number of coins stabilizes, select the coin type and click add.\n\n9. The dollar amount corresponding to the number of coins is added to the total.\n\nBy downloading and/or using this apps, the user agrees to the app store End User License Agreements, as well as the Terms and Conditions Listed in the app's info screen and in this document.\n\nTips:\n\n- Place the coins on a solid background, like a blank white sheet of paper, for best results.\n\n- Make sure the coin detection area is well-illuminated.\n\n- For obtaining more accurate counts, make sure that none of the green circles are flickering, and that there are no extra green circles.  The sensitivity slider, lighting, and background all influence accuracy.\n\nUsage Terms and Conditions:\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS,\" AND COPYRIGHT HOLDERS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR DOCUMENTATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.",

The popular Coin Counting Calculator uses realistic coin buttons for the penny, nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar. The Coin Counting Calculator has a display with the cent sign (¢), dollar sign ($), and 2-digit decimals. When the coin buttons are pushed, they add their money value to the amount at the top of the screen based upon the number of times they are pushed. \n\nThe count for each coin is updated underneath each coin image. Additionally, you can press the coin count underneath each coin and a convenient message box will prompt you to enter in specific coin count. \n\nThe Coin Counting Calculator can be used to count money and teach coin values. You can set the function of the calculator to add or subtract.",

            "description": "iPocketChange is a new and useful way to keep track of your coins.\n\nDo you have any coins in your pocket?\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n* Saves the quantity of each coin that exists in your wallet.\n* Tells you whether you can pay for something with exact change.\n* Automatically subtracts the amount you're paying from what you have.\n* Saves you money by keeping track of your coins and helping you to utilize them.\n\nTHE PROBLEM:\n\nA Subway sandwich is $5.41, including tax. You have six $1 bills, 1 quarter, 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 4 pennies. What would you give the cashier? If this question takes you more than 10 seconds to answer, stop fussing. Use iPocketChange, and save yourself the time and hassle.\n\nYou do these kinds of transactions every day. Eventually, we each have an enormous jar of coins. It's a hassle to count and wrap the coins, and it costs money to pay a machine to count them. iPocketChange is the solution. It keeps track of your change at the touch of a finger.\n\nWHY I USE IT:\n\nI have a bunch of coins in my wallet right now. Although I know there are coins in there, I have no idea which coins. It turns out that I have 6 quarters, 4 dimes, 1 nickel, and 1 penny. But once I dump these back in my wallet, I'll have no recollection of how many that was. All I'll know is: \"I have a bunch of coins in my wallet.\"\n\nUSAGE SCENARIO:\n\niPocketChange tracks the change you get, as you get it. When you pay for something with cash, you get a few coins back. Take out your iPhone or iPod touch, open iPocketChange, and tap the coins you just received. Sleep your device, and you're done. It's quick and easy. The app saves the information automatically, and now it knows what's in your wallet-- or purse, or whatever.\n\nNow here's the cool part. The next time you go to buy something, let's say the total is $8.58. Normally, you'd have no idea whether you need to pay $9 and get change, or if you have the right coins to pay for it exactly. Pull out your iPhone or iPod touch, and on iPocketChange's first screen, there's a sliding wheel for selecting the cents part of the item's cost. Scroll to 58, and the app will tell you whether you have exact change, based on what it knows is in your wallet. Let's say you have exact change. Tap \"Pay\", and the app automatically subtracts from your wallet's contents 2 quarters, 1 nickel, and 3 pennies-- 58 cents. Sleep the device, and pull out your wallet. You can be confident that you have the right coins to make exact change.\n\nFUN EXTRAS:\n\n* Original photos taken with a professional digital SLR camera.\n* Coin sound.\n* Accelerometer support: move the coins around the screen!\n\niPocketChange currently supports only U.S. currency, but if you're interested, we may add support for other currencies.\n\nDeveloped at USC, the University of Southern California\nPublished by GreenGar Studios\nFormerly Gengar Studios",
